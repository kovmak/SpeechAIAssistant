## Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of the Web Speech API for speech recognition and synthesis with OpenAI's ChatGPT API for natural language processing. It allows users to input questions via speech or text, sends them to the ChatGPT API for generating responses, and presents the responses both visually and audibly.

### Web Speech API
The Web Speech API provides speech recognition and synthesis capabilities in web applications. It enables users to interact with web content using their voice, converting speech to text and vice versa.

### OpenAI ChatGPT API
OpenAI's ChatGPT API offers a powerful natural language processing model capable of generating human-like text responses to given prompts. It can be used for various applications, including conversational agents, question answering systems, and content generation.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser to access the application.
3. Click the "Go" button to start speech recognition and ask a question either verbally or by typing it into the input field.
4. After processing, the response will be displayed in both text and audio formats.
5. Click the "Stop" button to stop speech recognition and synthesis.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: HTML file containing the user interface elements and integration of the Web Speech API.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for speech recognition, API requests to ChatGPT, and speech synthesis.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the user interface elements.
